# Stroustrup about Templates

<div class="hcenter">

In about 1987, I tried to design templates with proper interfaces. I failed. **I wanted** three properties for templates:

- Full generality/expressiveness
- Zero overhead compared to hand coding
- **Well-specified interfaces**

Then, nobody could figure out how to get all three, so **we got**
- Turing completeness
- Better than hand-coding performance
- Lousy interfaces (basically **compile-time duck typing**)

**The lack of well-specified interfaces led to the spectacularly bad error messages we saw over the years.** The other two properties made templates a run-away success.

# What are concepts?

<div class="hcenter">

<center>

"Concepts are a type system for types"
(B. Milewski in [C++ Concepts: a Postmortem](https://bartoszmilewski.com/2010/06/24/c-concepts-a-postmortem/))

</center>

So they offer classic advantages of strongly-typed type systems:

- constrain types
- improve error reporting
- overloading
- self-documenting code

# Once upon a time...

<div class="hcenter">

## <!-- fit --> It was early 2000s and `concept` concept was born.

...at least in C++ world, because it was not a completely new idea (e.g. Haskell already had `typeclass`es), but it needed some adaptions/extension for the C++ generic programming problems.

- In **2003** first `concept`s papers come up at WG21
(by Bjarne Stroustrup and Gabriel Dos Reis).

- In **2005** they were driven towards C++0x
with a paper [Concepts for C++0x](https://open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2005/n1758.pdf)

- In **2006**, **2007**, **2008** more papers about `concept` and STL (e.g. https://www.stroustrup.com/popl06.pdf)

**Stroustrup interview about Concepts C++-0x**

**Q**: Aren‚Äôt concepts about adding major new expressive power to the language, and so enable major new kinds of programs or programming styles?

**A**: Not really. **Concepts are almost entirely about getting better error messages**. [...]

Yes, **concepts would add one truly new expressive capability to the language, namely the ability to overload on concepts**. [...]

# Concepts: Placeholder Declaration

<div class="hcenter">

As Milewsky said "concepts is a type-system for types".

Indeed they express something for a type; we can use concepts next to types to constrain them.

```cpp
std::floating_point T
```

Actually, it is a placeholder declaration (like `template <class T>`), which defines constraints over the provided/deducible placeholder.

In the case above it means _"the placeholder `T` is constrained to respect the concept `std::floating_point`"_.

**It seems a very trivial thing, but it is already super powerful and expressive.**

---

<div class="hcenter">

We can use it to declare a named placeholder (e.g. `<class T>`) or an anonymous placeholder (`auto`)

```cpp
template <std::floating_point T>
std::integral auto foo(T a, T b);

std::floating_point auto x = foo(13.26, 3.14);
```

... but we still have to follow their rules.

# Overload

<div class="hcenter">

No need for negated constraints, ad hoc arguments, ... trying to achieve mutual exclusitivity among different overloads.

With concepts there is **partial ordering of overloads**.

It means it is not anymore a matter of enabling/disabling an overload from the overload set, but it is a matter of selecting the most specific one for the use-case among all available valid overloads.

And it applies also to class specialization!

    static constexpr auto value = "integral";

# Before introducing new keywords...
There is still one thing worth mentioning that can be done without additional keywords

---
# Concepts: true/false checks

<div class="hcenter">

We used concepts for declaring a constrained placeholder, but actually we can use the same concept to check that an instantiated placeholder respects it.

```cpp
std::floating_point<T>
```

yields a `constexpr bool` value, similarly to the good old trait.

This means that we can test that a type respect a concept.

```cpp
static_assert(    std::floating_point<float>);
static_assert(not std::floating_point<int>);
```

which is semantically the same as

```cpp
static_assert(    std::is_floating_point_v<float>);
static_assert(not std::is_floating_point_v<int>);
```

</div>

# Quick playground or continue?

</div>

---
<!-- _class: lead -->

# Let's introduce new keywords!

---
# `requires` clause

<div class="hcenter">

Till now we used concepts without using any new keyword. Declaring "constrained type placeholder" is not the only way to declare constraints for a type. Actually there are two other ways to express the same constraint using the `requires` keyword.

**Constraining the template**

```cpp
template <class T> requires std::floating_point<T>
T foo(T a, T b) {}
```

Or **constraining the function**
```cpp
template <class T>
T foo(T a, T b) requires std::floating_point<T> {}
```

`requires` clause checks that the given `constexpr` is `true`.

</div>

---
<div class="hcenter">

This means that we can pass to a `require` clause a concept like we did, but also whatever expressions returning `constexpr bool`.

So, we can use a trait
```cpp
template <class T>
void foo() requires std::is_floating_point_v<T>;
```

but also a call to a `constexpr` function

```cpp
template <class T>
void foo(T&& x) requires (std::signbit(-10));
```

or compose a boolean expression

```cpp
template <class T>
requires (std::integral<T> && !std::same_as<char>)
void foo(T&& x);
```

**NOTE**: the constant expression must be a primary expression. It can be easily achieved by parenthesizing an expression.

</div>

---
<!-- _class: lead -->

<div class="hcenter">

Also an **IILE** (aka _"Immediately Invoked Lambda Expression"_) returning a `constexpr bool` is a valid constraint.

```cpp
#include <source_location>

template <class T>
requires (
    [](const auto& line) {
        return line % 2 == 0;
    }(std::source_location::current().line())
)
void foo(T&& x) {
    // foo implementation

Yes, it's the same keyword...but previously we were talking about `requires`-clause, now we are introducing `requires`-expression!

```cpp
requires (parameter-list) {
    requirement_1;
    requirement_2;
    ...
    requirement_n;
}
```

+ `parameter-list` like for functions (optional)
Useful to get "symbolic" entities for the sake of defining requirements.
+ Each requirement has to be **verified** in order for a requirement expression to be true

A `requires`-expression is `true` if all requirements are **verified**, otherwise `false`.

A `requires`-expression gives us the ability to express a very complex set of constraints.

    requirement_n;
}
```

and all of them must be **verified** at the same time, like if they were joined by an AND.

# `requires`-expression parameter list

<div class="hcenter">

<cite>

A `requires`-expression can introduce local parameters using a parameter list. These parameters have no linkage, storage, or lifetime; they are only used as notation for the purpose of defining requirements.

</cite>

```cpp
requires (T a, T b) {
    { a == b } -> std::same_as<bool>;
};
```

Parameter list is somehow a shortand list of `declval`s you might want to use for requirement definition.

```cpp
requires {
    { declval<const T&>() == declval<const T&>() } -> std::same_as<bool>;
};
```

...and equivalently to `declval`, you can use them in unevaluated context (e.g. check type, check if builds) but not in evaluated context (because they don't actually exist).

# Concepts & Partial Order

<div class="hcenter">

Do you remember when we talked about partial ordering of overloads?

Concepts are partially ordered, which means that compiler can realise if a concept A subsumes a concept B.

How can it infer that? It normalises concept to a sequence of and/or between atomic constraints, then it does the logic comparison to know if the two normalised concepts are related.

There is just one pitfall: two atomic constraints are considered equivalent if and only if they are formed from the same expression at source level.

The idea is that **errors were detected too late** with plain templates. Indeed, with templates the full instantiation stack is created and if it turns out to be an error, the compiler dumps out all of it.

Adding a constraint **with concepts**, beside being easier than before which encourages the good practice of constraining templates, **it creates earlier error "detection" points in the instantiation stack**. Moreover, it is also an explicit requirement.

<div class="hcenter">

This is how the code was changed for constraining the type

```cpp
template <class T>
concept comparable = requires (const T& a, const T& b) { a < b; };

template <class T> requires comparable<T>
void sort(std::vector<T>& values) {
    std::sort(values.begin(), values.end());
}
```

And this is another selling point for concepts: it is not a "go big or go home" solution.

Indeed you can start using them in your codebase wherever you need them without a need for a full upgrade of you codebase. This is a very useful thing, because **they allow a smooth transition** at your pace, and IMHO it encourages adoption (if you can use c++20).

This was a very simple example.
The output is not always as nice as in this case or as we would like it to be.

But at least with concepts we have a way to break the chain of template instantiation, in an expressive way.

# CRTP vs Concepts

<div class="twocolumns">

<div>

```cpp
template <class T>
struct Shape {
    void draw() const {
        static_cast<const T*>(this)->draw();
    }
};

struct Torus : Shape<Torus> {
    void draw() const {
        std::cout << "TORUS";
    }
};

struct Cylinder : Shape<Cylinder> {
    void draw() const {
        std::cout << "CYLINDER";
    }
};
```

</div>

<div>

```cpp
template <class T>
concept Drawable = requires (T shape, const T& cshape) {
    cshape.draw();
};

struct Torus {
    void draw() const {
        std::cout << "TORUS";
    }
};

struct Cylinder {
    void draw() const {
        std::cout << "CYLINDER";
    }
};
```

</div>

</div>

- CRTP makes you decide if you want to "adopt" the interface, while with concepts it is "adopted" by default. Syntactically is correct, but semantically might not have sense.
- with CRTP you can inject function in the interface, while with concept you can just have "free functions"
- Previous point opens to a potential ADL issue: a user that defines a new type compatible with your library concept, cannot use free functions easily (either fully qualified name or some namespace workaround)

---
# `if constexpr`

<div class="hcenter">

This is another usage that starting from C++17 it has become common, and concepts can be helpful there too.

```cpp
template <class T>
struct P2D { T x, y; };

template <class T>
struct P3D : P2D<T> { T z; };

template <class T>
void print(const T& pt) {
    std::cout << "(" << pt.x << ", " << pt.y;
    if constexpr (requires { pt.z; })
        std::cout << ", " << pt.z;
    std::cout << ")" << std::endl;
}
```

</div>

# Conclusions

- **Are they nice?**
Yes
- **Are they the best we could have ever had?**
No (e.g. concept maps...)
- **Do they improve error messages?**
Yes and No.
- **Is it worth starting using them?**
Yes, they simplify meta-programming in a lot of situations, improving code readability and expressiveness. Moreover it makes the code self-documenting.
- **Is it a "go big or stay home" solution?**
Not at all! They allow a very smooth transition. You can start even just by partially using them mixed with other solutions (e.g. same function/class overloaded/specialised with both old methods and concepts).

**HINTS**
- `const` applies to the full type
(type, or concept + placeholder)
- constraint helps defining the type, soconcept and placeholder should be considered as a single thing
(i.e. concept and placeholder cannot be split apart)

# Concepts vs Parameter Pack

# Concepts vs Parameter Pack

<div class="hcenter">

```cpp
#include <concepts>

template <class... Args>
concept AtLeast2 = requires sizeof...(Args) >= 2;

template <AtLeast2... Args>
void foo(Args&&...) {}

int main() {
    foo(1, 2);  // error: AtLeast2<int>
}
```

With the syntax
```cpp
template <Concept... Placeholder>
```
we're applying the type constraint to each single type of the parameter pack, **NOT** to the parameter pack as a whole.

</div>

---
# Concepts vs Parameter Pack

<div class="hcenter">

```cpp
#include <concepts>

template <class... Args>
concept AtLeast2 = requires sizeof...(Args) >= 2;

template <class... Args>
requires AtLeast2<Args...>
void foo(Args&&...) {}

int main() {
    // foo(1);     // error: as per requirement
    foo(1, 2);
}
```

Now we are requiring that the full parameter pack `Args...` respect the concept `AtLeast2`.
