* Overview
- C++ evolving rapidly, but we may not see much of it in practice because some compilers keep us on C++17 or 20 at best
- We'll look at selected C++20/23/26 features
- Could not cover everything requested in the survey
  - Attempt to organize smaller, more frequent opportunities talk about C++
- Encourage C++ presentations, design discussion, reviews between teams
- Thank you to Alberto, Auriane, Christopher, Fabian, Hannes, Ioannis, Raffaele
